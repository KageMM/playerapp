Player App

This is intended to be used for various sporting activities.

Basic structure of the app:

1. Users will have the ability to reserve a spot for a particular match/game.

2. Users who accept an invite to a match/game will be automatically included in the player pool.

3. Special users(captains) will be able to select their players from this player pool.
